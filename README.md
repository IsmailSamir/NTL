## NTL :- Normal Template Library
This repo includes some sort of data structures and algorithms implementation using c++


#### goal :

   1. (classical algorithms implementations)      
   2. (correct! and ease of use, one .header file per Data structure or algorithm)        


#### Implemented :

| Name | File |
|------|------|
|Forward List|https://github.com/IsmailSamir/NTL/blob/master/ntl/include/ntl/Forward_List.h |
|List|https://github.com/IsmailSamir/NTL/blob/master/ntl/include/ntl/List.h |
